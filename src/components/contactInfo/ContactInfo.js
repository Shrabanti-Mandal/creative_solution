        Our successfull business meeting
      </h3>
      <h6 className="d-flex justify-content-evenly meeting-description">
        Meetings are vitally important â€“ if done well. Meetings help people feel
        included, trusted, and that they are important team members, as well as
        giving them the opportunity to contribute to the success of our
        companies. Meetings and individual one-on-one conversations are fuel
        that runs our companies.Having a team meeting gives team members a
        breathing space to get their heads out of work. It provides an
        opportunity for colleagues to refocus and reflect on their progress. All
        members have a chance to deliver in-depth reports on their progress and
        receive reports from their colleagues too.

        Online meetings have made it easier as well as cost effective to get all
        the stakeholders at one place without compelling them to move out of
        their office or home. Everyone can attend these meetings face-to-face
        just by making few clicks with their mouse.Are virtual meetings finally
        the most effective use of personnel and company time? According to
        research from Lifesize, 76% of people have used video collaboration to
        work remotely and 75% of those found an increase in productivity and
        enhanced work-life balance.
